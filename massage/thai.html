	       In this unique healing system of Thai Yoga Massage, also called Nuad Boran, the practitioner guides the client through a series of yoga postures, 
	       while palming and thumbing along the body’s energy (‘Sen’) lines and pressure points. 
	       Together these actions result in a comprehensive full body treatment that relieves muscular tension, 
	       improves circulation, boosts the immune system and balances the body energetically.
         <br>
         Thai Yoga Massage is performed on a mat on the floor; both client and practitioner are dressed in comfortable clothing allowing ease of movement and flexibility.
