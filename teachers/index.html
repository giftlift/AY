	      My yoga journey started  when I was given a yoga mat in my high school years and started exploring what it meant to ‘listen to my body’ and move accordingly.  
	      Almost ten years later, yoga has become that and so much more in my daily life.  Yoga has helped me find peace and home in my own skin.  
	      My hope is to share with others this joy and sense of stability that yoga has brought to all aspects of my life.  

	      As a middle school teacher working in Charlotte, NC I began my 200-hour yoga teacher training through Bella Vita Yoga with two incredible teachers,
	      Jillian and Carrie.  Bella Vita translates to ‘the beautiful or good life’ and that is exactly what I gained from the nine month teacher training program; 
	      a deeper understanding for living in vibrance and letting my inner light shine brighter each day to create my beautiful life and help others see theirs.  
	      I am constantly reading articles and books about yoga, trying new teachers, and discovery new awareness of my body and mind through my own personal practice.  

              I love creative flow and linking music to enhance my yoga classes.  I love to laugh and be real with myself and in turn be real with my students.  
              I love to play and explore different poses and even invent at times.   My hope each class is to create a nurturing environment where you, 
              no matter what physical or mental shape, level, or capacity can leave feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and at peace in your skin.

	      Rachel just completed her yoga teacher training at Inhale Yoga Studio this past spring and is a 200-hour registered yoga teacher. 
	      She has been practicing yoga for about 5 years now and draws inspiration from rebel yogis. She uses yoga to tune into her body and the moment and de-stress. 
	      Her "slow flow" class has a heavy emphasis on alignment and movement with breath and moving in a way that feels natural and right. 
	      This is good for beginners and those looking to deepen their practice.

	      Holly has been practicing yoga for several years, and somewhere along the way found it was too big of a gift not to share with others. 
	      She completed a 200-hour teacher training with Michelle Stobart at Inhale yoga Studio in 2016. 
	      The benefits of her yoga practice have enriched all aspects of her life and she is really excited to share these benefits with the Athens community.

	     How and what creates an individual perceptions of ‘reality’? Mary created ACIA as a vehicle for short, 
	     low cost workshops to benefit the integration of these perceptions in defining healthy life choices. 
	     The benefit of the workshops is to encourage the local community to have information and experiences balancing body, mind, and spirit. 
	     Body, mind and spirit will recalibrate given a chance to consider and then experience alternatives. 
	     Mary’s experiences include a 35 year nursing career nursing in Ohio, Texas and Massachusetts, two Masters degrees (MEd in counseling and Library Science), 
	     extensive shamanic studies on core shamanic practices, herbal studies, and various Buddhist theories. 
	     She has studied with mindfulness teacher John Kabot Zinn, shamanic practice teacher and author Sandra Ingerman, 
	     Foundation for Shamanic Studies (FSS) teachers, David Winston (AHG), and several Buddhist lineages, mostly Tibetan. She has an active meditation practice and enjoys yoga, music, dream work, 
	     and exploring synchronicities. She has teamed up with Athens Yoga instructors because the teachers are dedicated and motivated in the same way as ACIA. 
	     Mary is a native of Ohio who settled into the Athens area late 2012. 
	     Curious minds welcome!.
